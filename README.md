# Color Space: From Image to Object

This project develops ways beyond drawing to develop architectural spaces “Color Space”, is meant to challenge the dominance of the architectural drawing through color as a means of defining spaces to experiences. This is a project based off the design of a software but also based off a design methodology specifically using color. This plug-in will take images that use color as its primary gradient and use that as its means for developing architectural spaces. The software offers a way of imagining architecture through the system of image, then pixel, color, and then to space.
